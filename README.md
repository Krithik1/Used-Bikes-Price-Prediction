# Used Bikes Price Prediction

• A 1 month internship where we were taught basics of Python, Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

• Created a project called Used Bike Price Prediction where a dataset about used bike prices was used and a model was implemented using
the Random Forest Regression Algorithm.

• Built a website using Flask that used the model to predict the prices of used bikes accurately using properties of the Bike such as distance
travelled, age, power consumption, city and brand.

• Gained hands-on experience in machine learning, data analysis, and web development during the internship period.
